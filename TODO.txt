The TODO list

Circuit/PCB (Fingers):

The Easypoint switch is on Col5, but there is no pull-down on the
finger PCB for Col5, as the intention was to put the Col5 pull-down
on the Thumb PCB, along with the Col4 pulldown. This may have been
an error, as now the Easypoint switch can't be evaluated without
a kludge of soldering on a resistor somehow, at least until the
thumb switches are in the mix. Consider changing this.

Find a better layout for the solder-bridges in the reversible finger 
5-switch footprint - I resorted to 0603 0-Ohm bridges because I couldn't
get the solder to bridge across easily.

The drills for the test points are not quite large enough for the chosen
testpoints. Make the drill hits a few mil larger so that the testpoints fit
better into the plated holes.

DONE:
PCA9306 circuit needs to be corrected. VREF2 (5.0v) needs to be connected
through the 200kOhms resistor, not directly.

DONE:
SW1 footprint - correct soldermask on mechanical/mounting holes, add padring
  to aid in soldering of the switch for mechanical stability.

TRRS footprint has silkscreen only on one layer. Add to bottom layer.

1206 component footprints have no silkscreen for outline of part. Either
  reduce the soldermask size or move silkscreen away from pads so that it
  actually exists on the real board.

DONE:
PCA9306 text needs to be move to the PCA9306, rather than on the PCA9655e.

DONE:
Add label for PCA9655e.

Add outline of keystop/shroud on the bottom layer.

Add a guide in silkscreen to the solder-bridges, like done on the reversible
  finger 5-switch bridges.

Improve the silkscreen for the status LEDs, on both top and bottom.

Investigate convention for square v. round pads for LEDs... Ergodox diodes
  have long leg through square pad, dodohand currently reverse...

May be possible to tighten-up the pad <-> soldermask spacing so that less
of the traces are exposed coming off of the ASICs...

misc:

Update the clip bending jig drawing to reflect the new, shorter length
of one of the magnet-facing legs of the N/E/S/W clips.

3D_models:

Finger button issues:

DONE:
Orientation of parts when printed affect results.
Arrange Printable Left Fingers SCAD model (3D_models/plf.scad) such that all of 
the keys and the lower levers are arranged in the same orientation. Perhaps pick
the orientation that is currently used for the larger N/big key, as that 
resulted in a part which fit into the carrier without modification.

DONE:
The lower lever seems too narrow @ the retention pins. Side-to-Side slop is too
great. Try orienting same as big key for next print.

DONE:
The printing orientation of the N key vs. the E/S/W keys caused the magnet-
carrying portion of the key levers to be drastically different. Keep this in
mind when selecting the final printing orientation.

DONE:
Add New center clip retention block to plf so that they get printed.

DONE:
Extend clip support wall down to bottom of 5-key carrier to prevent lowlev
from getting out of place if pins get sloppy.

DONE:
The lower-lever retaining pins entry ramp ends in a point which doesn't
print well. Fix this by adding some material to make the point into a chamfer.

DONE:
When printed in their current orientation, the E/S/W keys do not fit into the 
carrier. The top of the retention pins are too high. Assembly required trimming.
Verify that the model is correct. -- DONE -- model was correct --

DONE:
The LowLev cannot be properly inserted into carrier. There is an interference 
between the pivot at the end of the lever and the clip support wall of the N (or
is it S?) key. 

DONE:
The center button stem is way too sloppy. It allows significant and undesirable
motion of the button. The supporting walls should be made into a longer guide to
restrict motion, and the gap for 3D-printing tolerances should be reduced in 
order to achieve a less-sloppy assembly. 
*** at the moment, the short support walls (which work with the retention bumps 
on the stem) have been lengthened slightly (lower edge lowered), and the gap has
been removed between the stem and the support walls. Upper edge of support
structure has been raised slightly as well. *** 

DONE:
The center button stem can jam on the corner of the anvil, trapping the key in
the pressed-down state. This should be prevented simply by reducing the slop in
the stem support. Additional measures should be taken to make this even less 
possible. (now anvil overhangs a bit so that there is a much greater margin for
error without jam)

DONE:
The magnets barely fit into the lower lever. (Now sidewalls moved out to
allow more room in anvil area where structure is too stiff to give easily.)

DONE:
The E/S/W keys don't clear the top edge of the carrier when installed.
(tweaked key_p_z slightly to raise keys)

DONE:
The actuation of the center button requires a bit more force than is perfectly
desirable, and is a bit too snappy for my taste. The clip should be moved 
inboard until it is against the center column to increase the leverage that the
stem has upon the magnet. This will make actuation of the button less snappy and
require less force.  Current build has the clips rounded so that less material
is directly against the magnet, which also helps.  Current build has center 
clips out of 0.015" stock.
*** clip2 relocated, lowlev updated accordingly, new retention mechanism 
created which should make assembly easier.

DONE:
The actuation of the N/E/S/W buttons is perhaps not snappy enough - feels a bit
mushy. This could be improved by using K&J Magnetics' B221 magnet (1/8"x1/8"x
1/16") instead of B4201 (1/4"x1/8"x1/32") as the B221 has a higher Surface 
Field, and could be biased to the top of the lever. This could provide a greater
holding force, and a steeper dropoff of pull as the lever is actuated.

DONE:
Now using a phototransistor which is less sensitive to ambient light (Everlight
PT908-7B-F) and has shorter leads than the LTR-301 which was used earlier. There
needs to be an new 3D model created for the PT908-7B-F which reflects the 
shorter, and equal-length leads so that it can be obvious that they are barely
long enough to work with the current pinkie riser.

DONE:
The pocket for the IR opto components was just a little too short. Some of the
pockets required pliers to get the components to snap in. The hight of the 
pocket should be slightly increased. (pocket now irlb_m_h_xtra = 0.1 taller.)

Case:

A model of a case should be developed. Ensure that the two units can be placed
closer together than the original DataHand. Perhaps the outer case and the hand
support will be part of a single model to reduce complexity and cost of 
manufacture. 3D-printed ceramic is a potential solution. mkawa's 3D printer may
also be a useful resource for a case.  laser-cut cardboard (or plywood/bamboo/acrylic/etc) may not be a bad option.

Thumb switches

DONE:
Develop a model for the two-stage thumb switch and keycap.

DONE:
Develop a model for the 4-count normal thumb switch.

Develop a model for the upper/inboard thumb switch keycap.

Develop a model for the main inboard thumb switch keycap.

Develop a model for the distal outboard thumb switch keycap.

Develop a model for the proximal outboard thumb switch keycap.

Finalize the positions of the thumb switches relative to eachother.

Create a two-sided PCB design for the thumb switches.
